# CS2600_GroupProject_Tetris
 This is a final project for the course: CS2600 as contributed by members of Group 7 at CPP. The purpose of this project is to perform a fully functioning Tetris game where the program portrays a version of the famous game, where the user is first given the rules of the game and how to play it. The game is played using W, A, S, D, to move the blocks around, and the Space Bar to drop the blocks to the bottom of the screen. Once a line is full of pieces of blocks, the line is cleared and the remaining pieces above the cleared line move down the screen. The game ends when any block/piece reaches the top of the screen, where the program then prints the Final Score, the Final Level reached, and how many lines were cleared during the game.
